Identification of minerals in mining engineering presents numerous challenges. Traditional methods often require specialized expertise and remain prone to error, whereas deep learning techniques promise simpler and more effective approaches. Below is a refined overview of seven key mineral categories:

- Biotite: Biotite, named in honor of the French physicist J. B. Biot, belongs to the mica subgroup of sheet silicates—which also includes muscovite, phlogopite, vermiculite, and lepidolite. It typically appears as irregular sheet masses, scattered flakes, scaly piles, or hexagonal crystals. Found in a variety of rocks, biotite is common in igneous formations such as granites, pegmatites, diorites, gabbros, and even peridotites. It also occurs in extrusive igneous rocks and forms in metamorphic environments under a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions.
- Bornite: Bornite is a copper-iron sulfide mineral that occurs in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Its distinctive iridescence—displaying shades of blue, purple, red, green, and yellow—makes it a popular specimen in museums, exhibits, and tourist shops. Typically found in massive lump form rather than as fine crystals, bornite is relatively softer than similar minerals.
- Muscovite: As the most common member of the mica family, muscovite is a fundamental rock-forming mineral in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. Its hallmark perfect cleavage enables it to split into thin, flexible, and transparent sheets with a pearly or vitreous luster. Muscovite may be colorless or exhibit hues of gray, brown, green, yellow, and, on rare occasions, purple or red. In industry, it is valued for enhancing the performance of plastics by improving properties such as stability, stiffness, and strength, as well as serving as an effective sound and vibration absorber.
- Chrysocolla: Chrysocolla is a hydrated copper phyllosilicate that serves as a minor copper ore. It typically occurs as cryptocrystalline, scaly, or amorphous botryoidal aggregates, with needle-like or fibrous crystals (pseudomorphs) being rare. In its pure state, chrysocolla is soft and fragile. When embedded in a quartz matrix, its optical and physical properties may closely resemble those of quartz.
- Quartz: Quartz is classified as a semi-precious stone and is widely utilized in jewelry, with various trade names reflecting its range of colors. A unique property of quartz is its piezoelectricity—it generates an electric charge when subjected to mechanical pressure. Notable varieties of quartz include amethyst, rock crystal, aventurine, ametrine, Eisenkiesel, and citrine.
- Malachite: Malachite is a green mineral composed of copper carbonate hydroxide. It is renowned for its striking banded patterns and the spectrum of green hues—from light to nearly black. Typically, malachite forms as stalactite-like or botryoidal structures on the surfaces of underground cavities, resembling calcite deposits found in caves. Although it rarely occurs in crystalline form, when present, its crystals are generally needle-shaped or flat, exhibiting an opaque, light-green appearance with a vitreous to adamantine luster.
- Pyrite: Pyrite, an iron sulfide mineral, is easily recognizable by its metallic luster and high specific gravity. It commonly exhibits brassy yellow or yellowish-gray tones. As one of nature’s most abundant minerals, pyrite displays considerable variation in shape—a direct result of differing environmental conditions and crystal growth processes during its formation.

Over the years, researchers have deepened neural network architectures by adding more layers to tackle complex tasks and enhance performance. However, this increased depth often complicates training and can lead to reduced accuracy, largely due to the vanishing gradient problem. ResNet (Residual Network) addresses these issues by introducing skip connections—also known as residual connections. These connections provide shortcut paths that bypass one or more layers, allowing gradients to flow more effectively during training. 

Transfer learning is a highly efficient approach in deep learning that leverages models pre-trained on extensive datasets. By reusing these learned weights, you can quickly develop a custom model tailored to your specific task without starting from scratch. The VGG network, for instance, is available in two primary architectures—VGG16 and VGG19. Initially, the VGG16 model was introduced, and later, the VGG19 model emerged as a refined version with minor architectural modifications.
